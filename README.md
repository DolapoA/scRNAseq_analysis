5. Visualising the differential expression of genes using volcano plot

6. Querying GWAS Catalogue APIs

7. Visualise gene expression of GWAS genes of choice using a dot plot

8. Generation of correlation matrices to look at relationships between gene pairs 

9. Checking for the enrichment of specific biological pathways
